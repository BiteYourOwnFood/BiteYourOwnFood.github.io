            "content_html": "<h3>History</h3>\n<h5>Egyptians</h5>\n<p>Lemonade works as best hydrating drink in summers. Who else would have thought it first other than Egyptians working in the middle of desserts in 10th century. They called it Khaskab.</p>\n<h5>Lemonade without lemons</h5>\n<p>Khaskab was originally made using mint, meadow rue(a pink flower without petals), black pepper and citron leaf. Yeah exactly first lemonade didn't have lemons in it. The Idea was to consume citric acid and Khaskab did the job.</p>\n<p>Lemonade so far fine and just needed to replace citron leaves with lemons, because lemons easily available. But people!!! People around the world made it weird.</p>\n<h5>Jewish</h5>\n<p>Jewish community in Cairo added sugar to it and started trading. Jewish were like \"if leaves can do enough then fruits must be great\". And then the \"Citron\" a larger variant of lemon was used instead of citron leaves.</p>\n<h5>Muslims</h5>\n<p>Muslims started mentioning them in some of their books and made it an Islamic thing. Just for Muslims in later generations to claim lemons didn't exist before them, as no written proof exists.</p>\n<h5>Fancy Paris</h5>\n<p>On dawn of 20 August 1630 Paris felt the need to launch it as a drink as they used sparkling water instead of just water and honey instead of sugar like Jewish started. Lemonade became a fancy drink in Paris since it was rare and costly. Lucky Parisians as this lemon trend helped them because lemon peels kept fleas on rats away from human. </p>\n<h5>People of science who's name starts with 'J'</h5>\n<p>Joseph Priestley a chemist from Britain developed a apparatus to make carbonated water.</p>\n<p>Johann Schweppe, a German-Swiss jeweler, developed a compressor pump to make carbonated lemonade and mass produce it in 1780s.</p>\n<h5>Immigrants</h5>\n<p>Europeans immigrants took it to America in 18th century.</p>\n<h5>Feminists </h5>\n<p>Some Feminists from Ohio thought they can replace alcohol with lemonade and started a movement with the slogan \"Good-bye to liquor, here's to lemonade.\"</p>\n<h5>Entrepreneur couple in Politics</h5>\n<p>American President Rutherford B. Hayes banned alcohol while his wife sold lemonade with her name on it \"Lemonade Lucy\". The recipe of which was from a book \"The Book of Household Management.\"</p>\n<h5>Disgusting Pink Circus</h5>\n<p>In 1857, Conklin's lemonade used tartaric acid and a single lemon per season for garnish. Once ran out of water so used the water from a tub in which his pink pants were rinsed in. Titled it as strawberry lemonade.</p>\n<p>in 1912, Henry E. Sanchez accidentally dropped red cinnamon candles to make pink lemonade.</p>\n<h5>Brown Lemonade</h5>\n<p>People from Northern Ireland used brown sugar instead of regular sugar and called it brown lemonade.</p>\n<h5>Clean Clear Confidence</h5>\n<p>Packed lemonade as we know of today is colourless for the reason being it's history. If it's(lemonade is) coloured don't trust it easily. Brands like 7up and sprite sell clear carbonated lemonades.</p>\n<h2>Method 1 (Plain)</h2>\n<h3>Ingredients</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Lemon (Half a lemon - approx 1 inch diameter)</li>\n<li>Water (Tap / Mineral)</li>\n<li>Soda (Plain Sparking water without )</li>\n<li><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">Flavourful pulp (2-3 table spoons of pulp - Litchi / Strawberry / Cranberry / Mulberry) </span></li>\n<li>Salt (Rock salt / Pink salt)</li>\n<li>Black Pepper (2-3 balls, prefer freshly crushed)</li>\n<li>Basil seeds (1 tablespoon Soaked in water for 10-15 minutes)</li>\n<li>Mint leaves (3-4 leaves)</li>\n<li>Ginger juice (2-3 drops) (Optional)</li>\n<li>Sweetener (White Sugar / Brown Sugar / Honey) </li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Estimated Time</h3>\n<p>10-15 minutes</p>\n<h3>Estimated Cost</h3>\n<p>100-500 Rupees per serving</p>\n<h3>STEPS </h3>\n<h4>Step 1 Prepare the base</h4>\n<p>Take any clean container and squeeze half a lemon.</p>\n<h4>Step 2 The pulp</h4>\n<p>Finely chop the fruits. Do not grind. We need the small flavourful packets of pulp as whole but granular enough to not need to chew.</p>\n<p>Sprinkle crushed black peppers and salt right away in the mix. This will give the drink a cloudy texture when sparkling water is added in the end.</p>\n<h4>Step 3 The aromatics</h4>\n<p>Finely chop 2-3 fresh mint leaves. Add it to the mix. Don't forget to keep one leaf aside for the garnish.</p>\n<p>Add 2-3 drops of freshly crushed ginger (Optional).</p>\n<h4>Step 4 The Layering</h4>\n<p>Take a glass and add in the basil seeds.</p>\n<p>Add in the lemon-pulp-mint paste we made.</p>\n<p>Top it with 2-3 Ice cubes.</p>\n<p>Add in the Sweeteners (Optional if Sparking water is already sweet).</p>\n<p>Finally pour in the Sparkling water slowly from the edge of the glass to avoid overflowing.</p>\n<h4>Step 5 The Garnish</h4>\n<p>Cut a slice of lemon to garnish on brim of the glass.</p>\n<p>Place that one mint leaf we kept aside previously, on the centre.</p>\n<h3>Serve </h3>\n<p>Serve before the Ice melts.</p>\n<h3>Good if having with...</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>If having food that needs acids to regulate the digestion, then lemonade is best choice</li>\n<li>Empty stomach also greatly beneficial</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Tips</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Use plain water with more mint and ginger juice as a remedy for a sore throat.</li>\n<li>Do not add lemon Zest. Unless you in Paris suffering from plague.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Notes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid copper, brass, bronze or silver utensils, as they can react with citric acid and cause side effects.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Related Recipes</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://biteyourownfood.com/sarcastic-lemonade/\">Simply Sarcastic</a> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://biteyourownfood.com/lemonade-recipe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lemonade Recipe</a></p>",
